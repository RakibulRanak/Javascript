var can be defined and assigned multiple times :
ex:
var name = ranak;
name = ashik;
var name = saki;


at this moment , name = saki .
So beware of var ,(declaring multiple times in a single scope)

let
-----

let can be defined once but assigned multiple time

const
-----
const can be defined and assigned once only
